# Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference
1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03

## WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE
Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.

Twenty-six degrees.

Twenty-seven.

Twenty-eight.

The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.

Twenty-nine degrees.

Thirty.

Thirty-one.

Still, nothing has happened.

Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.

## FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD
### What’s the difference between systems and goals?
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

- If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice.
- If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.
- If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your instructor.

### Four problems about goals
- Winners and losers have the same goals.
- Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
- Goals restrict your happiness.
- Goals are at odds with long-term progress.

# THE 1ST LAW - Make It Obvious
## Conscious self makes habits useful but also makes them dangerous
With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. 

You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your lungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles all this and more on autopilot. You are much more than your conscious self.

you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful.It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening.

Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it.

### [Pointing-and-Calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etUejYb48BE)
Pointing-and-Calling is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes.

Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.

One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.

Here’s a sample of where your list might start:
- Wake up
- Turn off alarm
- Check my phone
- Go to the bathroom
- Weigh myself
- Take a shower
- Brush my teeth
- Floss my teeth
- Put on deodorant
- Hang up towel to dry
- Get dressed
- Make a cup of tea
. . . and so on.

Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.

For example, the list above might look like this:
- Wake up =
- Turn off alarm =
- Check my phone –
- Go to the bathroom
- Go to the bathroom =
- Weigh myself +
- Take a shower +
- Brush my teeth +
- Floss my teeth +
- Put on deodorant +
- Hang up towel to dry =
- Get dressed =
- Make a cup of tea +

## The Best Way to Start a New Habit
**I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].**
- Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.
Studying. 
- I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my bedroom.
Exercise. 
- I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.
Marriage. 
- I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the kitchen.

### the Diderot Effect 
The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.

You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to get new shoes and earrings to match. You buy a couch and suddenly question the layout of your entire living room. 

### Habits stacking
No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.

When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.

The habit stacking formula is:

**“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”**

- Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.
- Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my workout clothes.
- Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that happened today.
- Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss.
- Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family member where I am running and how long it will take.

## Enviroments
- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.
- Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
- Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
- Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.
- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.

### self-control
Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.

**People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.**

A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
- If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a few hours.
- If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.
- If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out of the bedroom.
- If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews of the latest tech gear.
- If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use.
This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. **Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible.**

**Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one**. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control.

## THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP
Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.

Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.

After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]

## How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.
- Find love and reproduce = using Tinder
- Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook
- Win social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram
- Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google
- Achieve status and prestige = playing video games

## HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS
- change 'have to' to 'get to'
- “I need to go run in the morning” => “It’s time to build endurance and get fast”

# Make It Easy
## Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
- Focus on taking action, not being in motion. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.
- The biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: **you want to delay failure**
- The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.
